# Cave Development Log

## Project Overview
Cave is an AI-driven interactive storytelling backend using FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, and OpenAI API. The system supports characters, scenes, interactions, memories, feelings, and relationships, generating autonomous character interactions with persistent context.

## Major Updates and Improvements

### 1. Conversation Continuity Issue (Fixed)
**Problem**: Conversations were always starting over instead of continuing from previous interactions.

**Root Cause**: The scene was not properly maintaining conversation state between sessions.

**Solution**: 
- Added new backend endpoints to start fresh conversations (clearing previous interactions)
- Implemented conversation continuation with context from previous interactions
- Added save/discard conversation workflow
- Updated interactive script to use proper conversation management

**Files Modified**:
- `backend/main.py` - Added conversation management endpoints
- `test_interactive.py` - Updated workflow to handle conversation state

### 2. Memory System Optimization for Cost Control
**Problem**: The conversation memory was too large, leading to expensive API calls and token limits.

**Solution**: 
- Switched from storing full conversation history to key bullet points
- Implemented memory summarization to capture only important information
- Added memory importance scoring (1-5 scale)
- Created memory types: interaction, observation, feeling, revelation

**Files Modified**:
- `backend/models.py` - Updated Memory model structure
- `backend/ai_engine.py` - Added memory generation from interactions
- `backend/main.py` - Added memory management endpoints

### 3. Model Selection and Cost Optimization
**Problem**: High costs from multiple GPT-4 calls and long prompts.

**Solution**:
- Switched from GPT-4 to GPT-3.5-turbo for cost efficiency (~90% cost reduction)
- Added dynamic model selection feature
- Optimized prompts to reduce token usage
- Added model switching in interactive script

**Files Modified**:
- `backend/ai_engine.py` - Added model selection and optimization
- `backend/main.py` - Added model management endpoints
- `test_interactive.py` - Added model selection option

### 4. Natural Conversation Flow
**Problem**: AI was forcing conversations to follow specific character turns, making dialogue unrealistic and plot-driven.

**Solution**:
- Implemented unified conversation generation where all characters interact naturally
- Removed forced turn-taking
- Added varied speaker participation
- Focused on plot-driven dialogue without repetitive introductions

**Files Modified**:
- `backend/ai_engine.py` - Added `generate_unified_scene_conversation()` method
- Updated prompts to encourage natural dialogue flow
- Added conversation continuation with context

### 5. Narrative Elements and Environmental Descriptions
**Problem**: Conversations were purely dialogue without atmospheric details or character actions.

**Solution**:
- Enhanced AI prompts to include narrative descriptions
- Added support for character actions, movements, and expressions
- Implemented environmental descriptions and atmospheric details
- Added sensory details (sounds, smells, lighting, temperature)

**Files Modified**:
- `backend/ai_engine.py` - Updated prompts with narrative writing style
- Added interaction types: dialogue, thought, action, narration
- Enhanced system messages to emphasize novel-like writing

### 6. Token Limit and JSON Parsing Issues
**Problem**: Rich narrative content was being cut off due to token limits, causing JSON parsing errors.

**Solution**:
- Increased max_tokens from 400 to 800 for richer narrative content
- Improved JSON parsing to handle incomplete responses
- Added fallback extraction for partial JSON objects
- Enhanced error recovery for malformed responses

**Files Modified**:
- `backend/ai_engine.py` - Increased token limits and improved JSON parsing
- Added validation for interaction_type enum values
- Implemented robust error handling

## Technical Improvements

### Database Schema Updates
- Added `interaction_date` field for better timeline management
- Implemented `CharacterFeeling` model for relationship tracking
- Added `PlotNote` model for story development tracking
- Enhanced relationship system with multi-character support

### API Endpoints Added
- `/scenes/{scene_id}/conversation/start-fresh` - Start new conversation
- `/scenes/{scene_id}/conversation/continue` - Continue existing conversation
- `/scenes/{scene_id}/conversation/save` - Save conversation state
- `/scenes/{scene_id}/conversation/discard` - Discard changes
- `/ai/model` - Get/set current AI model
- `/scenes/{scene_id}/export` - Export scene to markdown

### Interactive Script Features
- Model selection (GPT-3.5-turbo vs GPT-4)
- Conversation management workflow
- Scene timeline viewing
- Story export to markdown
- Cost-optimized interactions

## Performance Optimizations

### Cost Reduction
- Switched to GPT-3.5-turbo: ~90% cost reduction
- Optimized prompts: Reduced token usage significantly
- Memory summarization: Reduced context length
- Batch processing: More efficient interaction generation

### Speed Improvements
- Reduced max token length for faster generation
- Skipped memory/feeling generation during fresh starts
- Optimized database queries with proper indexing
- Improved JSON parsing efficiency

## User Experience Enhancements

### Terminal Interface
- Clear menu system with numbered options
- Progress indicators and status messages
- Error handling with helpful messages
- Export functionality for story sharing

### Workflow Improvements
- Intuitive conversation management
- Easy model switching
- Quick scene navigation
- Story export capabilities

## Future Considerations

### Potential Enhancements
- Frontend web interface (can use a mobile phone style)
- Real-time collaboration features
- Advanced character relationship modeling
- Plot branching and multiple storylines
- Integration with external story databases

### Technical Debt
- Consider implementing caching for frequently accessed data
- Add comprehensive test coverage
- Implement rate limiting for API calls
- Add user authentication and story sharing

## Lessons Learned

1. **Cost Management**: Early optimization of AI model selection and prompt engineering is crucial
2. **User Experience**: Terminal interface can be as effective as web interfaces for certain use cases
3. **Memory Management**: Summarization and importance scoring are essential for long conversations
4. **Error Handling**: Robust JSON parsing and fallback mechanisms prevent system failures
5. **Iterative Development**: Small, focused improvements lead to better overall system quality
